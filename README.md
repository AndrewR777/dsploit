Some of you, the ones who know me personally, already know that starting from the last July I've become part of the [ZImperium](https://www.zimperium.com/) family as a software developer and security researcher. 
I've been "unofficially" already working/hacking with Elia, one of the two founders for 4 years, during this summer I met Zuk in Amesterdam and later on all of them in Tel Aviv.

We've talked a lot about this and finally we decided to join our efforts to create a better, faster and **free** product.

So I'm very proud to announce that dSploit was merged into zANTI, and the new version will (actually already is) zANTI2 which you can download **[here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/zANTI/zANTI2.apk)**. 
**zANTI2** will be released as an **open source** software in the near future, meaning that the community, towards which I'm deeply thankful, will continue to be able to contribute, test beta features and so forth.

**If you have an old version of dSploit ( anything rather than the last nightly build ), please remove it and download [zANTI2](https://s3.amazonaws.com/zANTI/zANTI2.apk) manually to have the latest code updates and features.**
